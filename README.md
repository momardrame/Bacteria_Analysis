# Plotly

## Purpose
I will use Plotly.js, a JavaScript data visualization library, to create an interactive data visualization for the web. The completed work will be displayed in a portfolio you create.

## Tools
-  JavaScript
-  HTML
-  D3.Json()

## Summary
-  Create basic plots with Plotly, including bar charts, line charts, and pie charts.
-  Use D3.json() to fetch external data, such as CSV files and web APIs.
-  Parse data in JSON format.
-  Use functional programming in JavaScript to manipulate data.
-  Use JavaScript’s Math library to manipulate numbers.
-  Use event handlers in JavaScript to add interactivity to a data visualization.
-  How to use interactivity to enhance your visualizations.
-  Deploy an interactive chart to GitHub Pages.

## Chalenge Objectives
The goals of this challenge are for you to:
-  Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
-  Create a bubble chart to visualize the relative frequency of all the bacterial species found in a volunteer’s navel.
-  Complete the demographic information panel, if you have not done so.
