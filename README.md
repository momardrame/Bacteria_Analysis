# Bacteria Analysis

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create an interactive data visualization for the web to illustrate the data for navel bacteria that were collected from individuals all accross the use.

## Project Overview
The goals of this project are to:
-  Create a bar chart of the top ten bacterial species in a volunteer’s navel. Use JavaScript to select only the most populous species.
